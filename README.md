## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Allow Camera Access**: The game requires a webcam to track your head position.
2.  **Move Head**:
    *   **MIND REALITY (Blue)**: Tilt head **Left** to move Left, **Right** to move Right.
    *   **SHIFT REALITY (Red)**: Controls are reversed! Tilt **Left** to move **Right**.
3.  **Dodge Walls**: Guide your ship through the gaps in the approaching digital walls.
4.  **Invincibility Shield**: A white shield appears for 3 seconds after each reality shift to protect you during the transition.
5.  **Lives**: You have 3 lives. Colliding with a wall depletes a life.
6.  **Adapt**: As your score increases, the reality mode will switch between MIND (Normal) and SHIFT (Inverted).
